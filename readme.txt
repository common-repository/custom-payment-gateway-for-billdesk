== Description ==
Extends WooCommerce to Process Payments with Billdesk gateway. My Custom Payment Gateway for BillDesk extends the functionality of WooCommerce to adding an option during checkout by Billdesk. So running a business means managing cash flow carefully. Many payment processors will hold your funds for days, and sometimes even weeks.
